# pseudo-elements-and-pseudo-class

Before diving into pseudo-selectors, a quick note on the difference between pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes. Pseudo-class selectors are prefixed with a single colon and are a different way to target elements that already exist in HTML. Pseudo-elements are prefixed with two colons and are used to target elements that donâ€™t normally exist in the markup.
